# Report recipes

Every recipe starts with `list_websites` and `get_metadata` for the site, and passes
`websiteId` (or `domain`) and the site's `timezone` to each call.

## The weekly health report

For each website the user wants covered (ask when `list_websites` returns several):

1. `get_overview` for last week and for the week before, both in the site's timezone.
   `fields`: `visitors,sessions,bounce_rate,conversion_rate,revenue`.
2. `list_issues` with `status: open`. Re-rank by `sessionsAffected`, descending.
3. `get_issue` on the top three, for the steps to replicate.
4. `get_pages` and `get_channels` for last week, `limit: 10`.

Write it in this shape, under 300 words:

**Headline.** One sentence: the single most costly thing happening now, with its number.

**What moved.** Last week against the week before, only metrics that changed by more
than 10%. Give both numbers and the direction. Skip anything flat.

**What broke.** The top three open issues by sessions affected: title, sessions affected,
the page it concentrates on, and the first step to replicate.

**Fix first.** One item and why it beat the others, in sessions and revenue exposure.

If nothing meaningful changed, say "quiet week" and list only the open issues.

## "What broke this week?"

`list_issues` with `status: open` and `sort: recency`. Keep the ones whose `lastSeenAt`
falls in the last 7 days (the tool has no date filter), and re-rank those by
`sessionsAffected`. For the top five, `get_issue`. For each: title, sessions affected,
whether it is getting worse (compare first and last seen), the steps to replicate, and
one line on what it likely costs based on the page it sits on. Then say which one a
developer should pick up first and which ones look like the same underlying cause. If
fewer than five are open, say so rather than padding the list.

## "How did the launch do?"

Ask for the launch date if you don't have it. Then:

1. `get_timeseries` with `interval: day` from a week before to a week after.
2. `get_channels` and `get_referrers` for the launch days.
3. `get_campaigns` if the launch used UTM tags.
4. `get_goals` for the launch days against the week before.

Lead with the peak day and how far above the baseline it was, then where the traffic
came from, then whether it converted.

## "Where do paying customers come from?"

`get_channels` and `get_referrers` for a window of at least 30 days, reading the
`revenue` column. Rank by revenue, not visitors, and give revenue per visitor for the top
sources. Add `filter_goal: payment` to count paying visitors per source. Small numbers
deserve a warning: three payments do not make a trend.

## "Why did signups drop?"

1. `get_timeseries` by day over the drop and the same length before it, with `filter_goal`
   set to the signup goal from `get_goals`, to find the day it started.
2. `get_channels` for the before and after windows with the same filter. A channel that
   fell away explains a traffic drop; flat channels point at the site itself.
3. `list_issues` with `sort: recency`, looking for issues first seen around that day on
   the signup or pricing pages.

Give the start date, the size of the drop, and the most likely cause with its evidence.
