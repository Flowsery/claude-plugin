# Flowsery Analytics Skill

Autonomously query and manage web analytics via [Flowsery Analytics](https://flowsery.com) API. Privacy-first analytics with real-time data, revenue tracking, and 24 breakdown dimensions.

> **Freshness check**: If more than 30 days have passed since the `last-updated` date above, inform the user that this skill may be outdated and point them to the update options below.

## Keeping This Skill Updated

**Source**: [github.com/flowsery/agent](https://github.com/flowsery/agent)

Update methods by installation type:

| Installation | How to update |
|--------------|---------------|
| CLI (`npx skills`) | `npx skills update` |
| Claude Code plugin | `/plugin marketplace update` |
| Cursor | Remote rules auto-sync from GitHub |
| Manual | Pull latest from repo or re-copy `skills/flowsery/` |

## Setup

1. Create a Flowsery account at [flowsery.com](https://flowsery.com)
2. Add your website and install the tracking snippet
3. Go to **Site Settings > API** tab and generate an API key
4. Store your API key in workspace `.env`:
   ```
   FLOWSERY_API_KEY=flow_sk_live_xxxxx
   ```

Or run the setup command:
```
./scripts/flowsery.js setup --key flow_sk_live_xxxxx
```

## Auth

All requests use Bearer token:
```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

Base URL: `https://analytics.flowsery.com`

**Config priority** (highest to lowest):
1. `FLOWSERY_API_KEY` environment variable
2. `./.flowsery/config.json` (project-local)
3. `~/.config/flowsery/config.json` (user-global)

### Handling "API key not found" errors

When you receive an "API key not found" error from the CLI:

1. **Tell the user to run the setup command** — setup requires user input, so you cannot run it on their behalf:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/flowsery.js setup --key flow_sk_live_xxxxx
   ```
2. **Stop and wait** — do not continue with the task. You cannot query analytics or perform any API operations without a valid API key.
3. **DO NOT** search for API keys in env files, keychains, or other locations.

## MCP Integration

Flowsery has a native MCP server. If you're using Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client, you can connect directly.

**Claude Code / Cursor / Other MCP clients** — add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowsery": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.flowsery.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer flow_sk_live_your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Automation Guidelines

- **Read-only by default** — most commands are safe GET queries with no side effects
- **Delete with caution** — `goals:delete` and `payments:delete` are irreversible; always confirm with the user before running
- **Revenue data is sensitive** — when displaying payment or revenue data, ask the user about the appropriate level of detail
- **Rate limits** — avoid polling `realtime` more than once per 5 seconds
- **Date ranges** — when the user says "this month" or "last week", calculate the actual ISO dates
- **Timezone** — always call `metadata` first to get the site's timezone; use it for all subsequent queries

## Tips

- Call `metadata` first to get the site timezone and currency — use these for all queries
- Use `overview` for a quick health check of the site
- Use `timeseries --interval day` for trend analysis and charting
- Combine filters to drill down: `--filter_country "United States" --filter_device mobile`
- Use `breakdown --dimension all_params` to see all tracking parameter performance at once
- Check `realtime` before and after deploying content changes to see immediate impact
- Use `visitor --id <id>` to build a full picture of a specific user's journey
- For revenue questions, use `overview --fields revenue,conversion_rate` or `timeseries --fields revenue`
- Use `channels` to understand your traffic mix before drilling into specific sources
